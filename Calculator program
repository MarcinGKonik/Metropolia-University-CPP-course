/* Exercise description

Write a program that asks user for two integers and prints the sum, difference, product and remainder of the two numbers.
Example output:

Input first integer: 5
Input second integer: 9
5+9 = 14
5-9 = -4
5*9 = 45
Remainder: 5
*/

// Solution

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main(){

    cout << "Input first integer: ";
	int first;
	cin >> first;

	cout << "Input second integer: ";
	int second;
	cin >> second;

	int sum;
	sum = first + second;

	int dif;
	dif = first - second;

	int prod;
	prod = first * second;

	int rem;
	rem = first % second;
	
    cout << first << "+" << second << " = " << sum << endl;

	cout << first << "-" << second << " = " << dif << endl;

	cout << first << "*" << second << " = " << prod << endl;

	cout << "Remainder: " << rem << endl;

	return 0;

	
	
	
}
