Max score: 1

The purpose of this exercise is to introduce you to writing programs with C++. Below is a C++ program. Your task is to rewrite it. In the next chapter you will learn how the program functions and what it actually does.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int number;

    cout << "Input an integer:";
    cin >> number;
    cout << "You typed: " << number << endl;
}

Example output:

Input an integer:12
You typed: 12
*/

// Solution

#include <iostream>

int main(){
    int number;

	std::cout << "Input an integer:";
	std::cin >> number;
	std::cout << "You typed: " << number << std::endl;
	
}
