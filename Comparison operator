/* 
Write a program which asks the user whether they prefer coffee or tea, and how many sugar cubes they put in. The program's output depends on the user's answers:

    Coffee, 0-2 cubes: "Coffee certainly is invigorating!"
    Coffee, 3+ cubes: "Well, coffee can taste pretty intense..."
    Tea, 0-2 cubes: "Tea can have a soothing effect!"
    Tea, 3+ cubes: "Guess you enjoy your tea overly sweet?"
    Otherwise: "An error occurred in the program!"

The sugar cubes are handled as an integer variable and the drink as a character variable ('c'/'t'). Uppercase can be ignored.

Tip:
Spend enough time designing the program's flow before starting to write it.
Example output:

Do you drink coffee or tea? (k/t) t
With how many cubes of sugar? 5
Guess you enjoy your tea overly sweet?
*/

// Solution

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Do you drink coffee or tea? (k/t) ";
    char x;
    cin >> x;
    cout << "With how many cubes of sugar? ";
    int z;
    cin >> z;

    if(z < 0){
        cout << "An error occurred in the program!" << endl;
    } else if( x == 'c' && z <= 2){
        cout << "Coffee certainly is invigorating!" << endl;
    } else if(x == 'c' && z >= 3) {
        cout << "Well, coffee can taste pretty intense..." << endl;
    } else if(x == 't' && z <= 2){
        cout << "Tea can have a soothing effect!" << endl;
    } else if(x == 't' && z >= 3){
        cout << "Guess you enjoy your tea overly sweet?" << endl;
    }  else {
        cout << "An error occurred in the program!" << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
