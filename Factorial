/* Exercise description
Write a program that asks user for an integer n (n>0) and prints the factorial of that number on screen. Example: factorial of n is marked with n!, which means 1*2*3...n.
Example output:

Input an integer: 6
The factorial of number 6 is 720
*/

// Solution

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Input an integer: ";
    cin >> n;

    int factorial = 1;

    // Loop from 1 to n
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        factorial *= i;  // Multiply factorial by i
    }

    cout << "The factorial of number " << n << " is " << factorial << endl;

    return 0;
}
