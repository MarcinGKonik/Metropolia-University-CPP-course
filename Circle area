/* Exercise description

Write a program that asks for the circle radius and calculates the area of the circle based on it. In the end the area is printed on screen. Use the approximate value of 3.142 for Ï€. User is expected to input only integers.

Tip:

Circle area is A=\pi \cdot r^2, where r is circle radius.
Example output:

Input circle radius:9
Circle area with the given radius: 254.502
*/

// Solution

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main(){

	cout << "Input circle radius:";
    double x;
	cin >> x;
	
    float z =  3.142 * pow(x, 2);
	
	cout << "Circle area with the given radius: " << z << endl;
	
	
}
