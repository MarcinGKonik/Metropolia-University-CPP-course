/* Exercise description

Below is a simpler version of the previous program but the idea is still the same. Program creates an object names “thing”, which is an instance of the class “AskAndPrint”. Your task is to write the class “AskAndPrint” and create a method “DoYourThing()” that receives the string from the variable “text”, prints it's contents, reads user input and prints it on screen. Write only the missing class in the below text box. The functionality of the complete program can be seen in the example print.

Tip:

User may input spaces so reading simply cin >> text; is not enough.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// your code here

int main (void)
{
    char charstring[] = "Write the text for printing: ";
    AskAndPrint thing;
    thing.DoYourThing(text);
}

Example output:

Write the text for printing: second example
second example
*/

// Solution

#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;
class AskAndPrint {
public:
    void DoYourThing(const char* text) {
        cout << text;
        
      
        string userInput;
        getline(cin, userInput);
        
        
        cout << userInput << endl;
    }
};
int main (void)
{   
   char charstring[] = "Write the text for printing: ";
   AskAndPrint thing;
   thing.DoYourThing(charstring);
}
