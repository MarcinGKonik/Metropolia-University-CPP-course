/* Exercise description

Write a program that asks for student's exam grades (integers 4-10 inclusive) and prints the average of the given numbers. Integers outside of the 4-10 range should not be included when calculating the average. Program receives numbers until input is finished by inputting a negative number. Finally the program prints the amount of grades and their average.

Tip:

You can use either while or do-while statement for this exercise. Use floating point numbers for storing grades and their average.
Example output:

Program calculates the test grade average.
Finish inputting with a negative number.
Input grade (4-10) 3
Input grade (4-10) 5
Input grade (4-10) 7
Input grade (4-10) 9
Input grade (4-10) 11
Input grade (4-10) -2
You inputted 3 grades.
Grade average: 7

//Solution

#include <iostream>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    
    float sum = 0;
    int count = 0;
    int grade;

    cout << "Program calculates the test grade average.\n";
    cout << "Finish inputting with a negative number.\n";

    
    while (true) {
        
        cout << "Input grade (4-10) ";
        cin >> grade;

        
        if (grade < 0) {
            break;
        }

        if (grade >= 4 && grade <= 10) {
            sum += grade;
            count++;
        }
    }

    if (count > 0) {
        float average = sum / count;
        cout << "You inputted " << count << " grades.\n";
        cout << "Grade average: " << average << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "No valid grades were entered.\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
